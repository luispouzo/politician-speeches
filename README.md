# Politician Speeches system
#### Description.
A politician will give many speeches in their political career. Many politicians
currently draft their speeches in an ad-hoc fashion using Microsoft Word and
share versions with their team using email. This process is inefficient as it does not
allow for the users to centrally store, archive, and search their speeches. This
challenge will require you to design a portion of a system to automate this
process.

### Requirements
1. View all their speeches saved in the system.
2. Add a speech to the system (for this challenge we will consider a speech to
   have the actual text, the author information, keywords about the speech
   and a speech date).
3. Edit a speech or its metadata
4. Delete a speech
5. The ability to search the speeches â€“ (search by author, date range, subject
   area, or snippets of text from the speech body.

### Containerization
The App is containerized using docker and docker-compose.

### Extra Features
Reusing Docker Layers For Creating An Efficient Docker Image

### Endpoints and payloads
Using Postman Swagger UI for more Details (http://localhost:8080/ps-api-ui.html)

### Project Configuration Details

#### Docker

* `Inside the db-initialization folder contained the SQL scripts to initialize the database and populate it with some initial data.
  Those docker-compose use those files`
* `Inside the src/main/docker folder is contained the docker files to create the docker images`
* `.env file (located in root dir) contains the variables for db connection among others used by docker-compose 
  docker-compose.yml file (located in root dir) contains the docker containers configuration`


### Project Setup

Prerequisites
- Java 17 --> Necessary to create the jar file to run inside the container
- Docker 20.10.14 --> To run the app and download the external services
- git --> to clone the project

Steps
```shell
# download the source
git clone <repo-url>

# go into the cloned directory
cd politician-speeches

# build the project to create the jar file 
# (optional: use '-Dmaven.test.skip=true' to skip unit test cases)
mvn clean package

# Run the application in the container
# (optional: use '-d' to run docker in background)
docker-compose up

# Check is the app was successfully executed
docker-compose ps 

# Test the App with a web browser
-- Open a web browser go to http://http://localhost:8080/ps-api-ui.html
```

### Project Setup (ALTERNATIVE)

`in case you don't want to run the application using docker, you can run the PoliticianSpeechesApplication class using
an IDE like IntelliJ. In this scenario, the database must be up and  configured`

#### Technology Stack
* Java 17
* Maven 3.8.4
* Spring Boot 2.7.3 / Starters (data-jpa, validation, web)
* H2
* Postgres 9
* openapi 1.6.8
* Docker (docker-compose) 20.10.14
* JUnit 5
* Mockito 4.0

#### Testing
From Command line run this command inside the poject root directory:
```shell
mvn test -e
```
This will run the unit test cases

*USING POSTMAN*
